This study mainly focuses on the user behaviors in Twitter after the emergence of the 2020 BLM Movement.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is composed of two main parts: Users that involving BLM movement [`blm_user_and_tweet_ids.7z`](https://github.com/avaapm/BlackLivesMatter/raw/master/blm_user_and_tweet_ids.7z) and control group users [`control_user_and_tweet_ids.7z`](https://github.com/avaapm/BlackLivesMatter/raw/master/control_user_and_tweet_ids.7z). Columns of the dataset are the same and defined as follows:
